## Graduate Students

### Sam DiCeccoSam

![](sam.jpg){width="147"}

Sam is a sixth year doctoral student in the Cognitive Psychology program through the Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Neurosciences program at Colorado State University. He received his B.S. at The Ohio State University in Psychology with a minor in Chemistry, and focused on combining his interest in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, individual differences, psychopharmacology, and risky behavior. With Dr. Seger, he has been focusing on using neuroimaging technologies such as fMRI and fNIRS to investigate activity in the brain concerning reward and novelty, and how these traits affect attention. He further collaborates with Dr. Brad Conner to investigate sensation seeking personality trait and risky behavior, as well as with Dr. Hollis Karoly on the neural effects of acute cannabis administration and co-use with alcohol.

### Sanjiti Sharma

Sanjiti is currently a first-year Ph.D. student with a Bachelor's degree in Biology with a minor in Psychology. Her four-year research journey during her undergraduate years revolved around cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, with a primary focus on attention and mindfulness, expertly integrated with Virtual Reality technology.

Within the Seger lab, Sanjiti is actively engaged in a wide spectrum of cutting-edge projects that explore neural systems governing habit learning and their intricate interactions with other learning and memory systems. Her research incorporates the latest fMRI techniques, enhancing the depth and precision of our research initiatives.

### JoJo Martis

JoJo is a first year PhD student who received his Masters in Experimental Psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience from Texas Tech University. Since completing his thesis "Selective Attention Differences Across Altered States of Consciousness", he worked as a Research Associate at The Ohio State University Medical Center where he investigated neurological markers associated with attention and sensory processing differences in children and adults with autism.

## Undergraduate Research Assistants

### Emily Stewart

Emily Is an undergraduate senior who began her higher education academic journey in Electrical Engineering. After her first semester she switched to Neuroscience. She figured if she made it this far, she may be smart enough to help her and her peers overcome depression. She has since learned that there are copious amounts of variables that affect the likelihood of depression. She has now shifted her attention to relationship building between one or two individuals --- or on a larger scale within a community. Emily is currently exploring what aspects of life increase feelings of closeness, warmth, and trustworthiness between individuals. Her efforts are motivated by her studies to gain knowledge and strategies so that she may help lead young adults in combating the loneliness epidemic.Â
