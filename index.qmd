Welcome to the Seger Lab, directed by Dr. Carol Seger, in the Department of Psychology at Colorado State University.

Our lab uses fMRI and cognitive psychology methods to investigate a variety of questions about human learning and cognition.

Our core research examines how interactions between basal ganglia and cortex in corticostriatal "loops" contribute to category learning. We also collaborate on a variety of projects in areas as diverse as risk taking in adolescence, recognition memory, musical harmony and rhythm processing, and neuroeconomics.

### **The lab is accepting Undergraduate Assistants!**

Check the Prospective Students page for more information.
