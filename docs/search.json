He received his B.S. at The Ohio State University in Psychology with a minor in Chemistry, and focused on combining his interest in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, individual differences, psychopharmacology, and risky behavior. With Dr. Seger, he has been focusing on using neuroimaging technologies such as fMRI and fNIRS to investigate activity in the brain concerning reward and novelty, and how these traits affect attention. He further collaborates with Dr. Brad Conner to investigate sensation seeking personality trait and risky behavior, as well as with Dr. Hollis Karoly on the neural effects of acute cannabis administration and co-use with alcohol.\n\n\nSanjiti Sharma\n\nSanjiti is currently a first-year Ph.D. student with a Bachelor’s degree in Biology with a minor in Psychology. Her four-year research journey during her undergraduate years revolved around cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, with a primary focus on attention and mindfulness, expertly integrated with Virtual Reality technology.\nWithin the Seger lab, Sanjiti is actively engaged in a wide spectrum of cutting-edge projects that explore neural systems governing habit learning and their intricate interactions with other learning and memory systems. Her research incorporates the latest fMRI techniques, enhancing the depth and precision of our research initiatives.\n\n\nJoJo Martis\n\nJoJo is a first year PhD student who received his Masters in Experimental Psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience from Texas Tech University. Since completing his thesis “Selective Attention Differences Across Altered States of Consciousness”, he worked as a Research Associate at The Ohio State University Medical Center where he investigated neurological markers associated with attention and sensory processing differences in children and adults with autism."

After her first semester she switched to Neuroscience. She figured if she made it this far, she may be smart enough to help her and her peers overcome depression. She has since learned that there are copious amounts of variables that affect the likelihood of depression. She has now shifted her attention to relationship building between one or two individuals — or on a larger scale within a community. Emily is currently exploring what aspects of life increase feelings of closeness, warmth, and trustworthiness between individuals. Her efforts are motivated by her studies to gain knowledge and strategies so that she may help lead young adults in combating the loneliness epidemic. \n\n\nRafaella Workman\n\nRafaella is a senior undergraduate student in the Psychology program with great interest in neurodegenerative diseases and the cognitive-behavioral implications of traumatic brain injuries. She has spent her time at Colorado State University gaining hands-on experience with data analysis software, psychological task programming, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalogram, and other research-based tools to broaden her foundational framework of knowledge in the realms of psychology and neuroscience. In the coming years, she hopes to enter a clinical neuropsychology doctoral program and begin working in healthcare."

Much of our research focuses on category learning, which we believe serves as an excellent model system for learning processes generally. We find that different loops make different contributions to category learning. The visual loop helps to process the visual stimulus and map it to the correct category. The motor loop helps to select the correct motor response (e.g., pressing a key on a computer keyboard) to indicate the category. The motivational loop processes the feedback reward associated with categorizing correctly or incorrectly, including calculating a reward prediction error. Finally the executive loop helps to chose the correct strategy for categorization, and works with the motivational loop to process reward and feedback, including predicting the expected feedback or reward associated with each categorization trial.\nOur approach to Cognitive Neuroscience is integrative. When studying the corticostriatal system, our goal is to understand its function by combining information from the fields of anatomy, neurophysiology, computational neuroscience, behavior, and cognition. Although our empirical work studies humans we believe it is important to understand the functions of the basal ganglia across species. We also study how the corticostriatal system interacts with other neural systems, such as the hippocampus."

Several faculty members who do neuroimaging have joined CSU in the past couple years as well across several departments (Psychology, Human Development and Family Studies, Occupational Therapy, Health and Exercise Science), and we are working together to develop new courses and new collaborations.\nWhat we are looking for in prospective graduate students:\nTo be successful in graduate school a student must be intelligent, hard-working, and passionate about science. In admissions we use grades, recommendation letters, and other application materials primarily as clues as to whether a student has all these important qualities.\nStudents need not have undergraduate degrees in Psychology; Biology, Neuroscience, and related fields can provide an equally good foundation for cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.\nIn addition because functional neuroimaging is a highly quantitative field; a background in mathematics, statistics and / or computer science is definitely a plus.\nIt is important to have research experience before committing to a Ph.D. program; the skills needed to excel in scientific research are not the same as those needed to do well in science courses. Many students who love to study science dislike the day to day challenges and frustrations of lab work."

    "text": "Prospective Undergraduate Students:\nWe also have openings for undergraduate research assistants. Most of our students are majoring in Neuroscience or in Psychology, but we have also had students from Biology and Computer Science. We especially are on the lookout for first or second year students who can be involved in the lab for a number of years. Students have the opportunity to get deeply involved in individual projects that can culminate in a senior thesis or other capstone project. Vulineering as a research assistant allows for flexible time commitments.\nIf you are interested, email Carol Seger (seger at colostate dot edu) for more information."
